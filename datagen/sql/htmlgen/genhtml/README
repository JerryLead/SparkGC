There are two programs here:

genhtml -- Generate a collection of fake HTML files with links between them
parsehtml -- Parse the HTML files output by genhtml and compute URL frequencies

See comments at the beginning of genhtml.c and parsehtml.c for usage instructions.

To build, type:

make genhtml

or

make parsehtml
